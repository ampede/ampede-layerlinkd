UKKQUEUE
--------

A wrapper class around the kqueue file change notification mechanism.

Simply create a UKKQueue, add a few paths to it and listen to the change notifications via NSWorkspace's notification center.

commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.
