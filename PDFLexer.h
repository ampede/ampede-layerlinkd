// nextTokenWithError: is the main method. It returns the next next token from the data passed to the parser.
// If it returns nil, and error is nil, there are no more tokens to return. If error is non-nil, there
// was a lexer error. See the NSError object for the error ( e.g. [error localizedDescription] );
// The object returned is autoreleased.
// If an error is returned, the caller is responsible for releasing it. (error is not autoreleased)
//
// If you send incomplete PDF data, and you parse to the end of the data, you may receive a final error object
// if the machine did not end in an accepting state. If the data was supposed to contain a complete file,
// you'll want to notify the user. Otherwise, just release the error object and ignore the error.
// In general, it's more efficient to stop parsing when you've received all the tokens you need.

- (id)nextToken;
	// if the token is an NSError object, it's sent a retain message, assigned by reference to error, and nil is returned.
	// otherwise, the token is returned unmodifed to the caller and error remains set to nil.
	// if there are no more objects, return nil, leaving error unmodified.

- (void)addToken:(id)theToken;
	// This is called by the machine to append a newly discovered token.
	// 
	// When an NSError token is added, it should contain the byte and line number from where the error occurred
	// in the error object's user-info dictionary.
	
- (id)nextTokenForLexer:(PDFLexer *)lexer;
	// note: this method verifies that lexer == self. It should only be called by the lexer object.
	// this should return nil if there are no more tokens in the buffer, and there were no more tokens after a call to
	// bufferTokens;
	
- (void)bufferTokens;
	// this buffers more tokens, if there are any
	// if the machine doesn't produce any more tokens and the machine was in a non-accepting state or an error state
	// this method constructs an error object to that affect and places it in the buffer
	// if the machine ended normally, then it does nothing
